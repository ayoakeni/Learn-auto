      <h2>Usage of Vocabulary in Context</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding how to use vocabulary in context is essential for effective communication. It helps to convey the correct meaning and tone, making our speech and writing more precise and nuanced.
      </p>
      <h3>Understanding Context</h3>
      <p>
        Context refers to the words, sentences, and ideas that surround a particular word or phrase. It provides clues about the meaning and usage of the word. For example, consider the word "bark":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>In the context of trees:</strong> The bark of the tree was rough and thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In the context of animals:</strong> The dog's bark was loud and echoed through the neighborhood.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In each case, the context helps us understand whether "bark" refers to the outer covering of a tree or the sound made by a dog.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Vocabulary Appropriately</h3>
      <p>
        To use vocabulary appropriately in context, it's important to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Know the meanings:</strong> Understand the various meanings of a word and how they change with context.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Read widely:</strong> Exposure to different contexts through reading helps in understanding how words are used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice:</strong> Use new vocabulary in sentences and conversations to become comfortable with their context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Examples of Vocabulary in Context</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some examples to illustrate the use of vocabulary in different contexts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bright:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>In the context of light:</strong> The room was bright with sunlight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In the context of intelligence:</strong> She is a bright student who excels in her studies.
            </li>
          </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In the context of managing something:</strong> She will run the company efficiently.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        By paying attention to context, we can choose the right words and use them effectively in our communication.
