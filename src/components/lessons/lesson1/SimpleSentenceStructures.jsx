      <h2>Simple Sentence Structures</h2>
      <p>
        Constructing sentences is a key part of language learning. In this section, you will learn how to put together simple sentences using the grammar and vocabulary you have learned.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Sentence Formation</h3>
      <p>
        The basic structure of a sentence typically includes a subject, a verb, and an object. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject + Verb + Object:</strong> I (subject) eat (verb) apples (object).</li>
        <li><strong>Subject + Verb:</strong> She (subject) sleeps (verb).</li>
        <li><strong>Subject + Verb + Adjective:</strong> They (subject) are (verb) happy (adjective).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
      <p>
        Forming questions is an essential part of communication. Here are some simple structures for asking questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes/No Questions:</strong> Do you like apples? (Yes, I do. / No, I don't.)</li>
        <li><strong>Wh- Questions:</strong> What do you like? (I like apples.)</li>
        <li><strong>How Questions:</strong> How are you? (I am fine.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Positive and Negative Sentences</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to be able to express both positive and negative statements. Here are examples of each:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive Sentence:</strong> I like apples.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Sentence:</strong> I do not (don't) like apples.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
      <p>
        Practice forming your own sentences using the structures above. Try to create sentences that are relevant to your daily life to make the learning process more engaging and practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some practice exercises:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Form a sentence using the structure Subject + Verb + Object.</li>
        <li>Ask a yes/no question and provide an appropriate answer.</li>
        <li>Create a positive and a negative sentence about something you like or dislike.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consistent practice will help you become more comfortable with sentence formation and improve your overall language skills. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, as they are a natural part of the learning process.
