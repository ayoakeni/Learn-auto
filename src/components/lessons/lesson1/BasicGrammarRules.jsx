      <h2>Basic Grammar Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding grammar is crucial for constructing meaningful sentences and communicating effectively in any language. In this section, we'll cover the fundamental grammar rules that form the backbone of the language you are learning.
      </p>
      <h3>Parts of Speech</h3>
      <p>
        The basic building blocks of any language are the parts of speech. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nouns:</strong> Words that represent people, places, things, or ideas (e.g., cat, city, happiness).</li>
        <li><strong>Pronouns:</strong> Words that replace nouns (e.g., he, she, it).</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs:</strong> Words that express actions or states of being (e.g., run, is).</li>
        <li><strong>Adjectives:</strong> Words that describe nouns (e.g., blue, quick).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs:</strong> Words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., quickly, very).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions:</strong> Words that show relationships between nouns or pronouns and other words in a sentence (e.g., on, in, by).</li>
        <li><strong>Conjunctions:</strong> Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or).</li>
        <li><strong>Interjections:</strong> Words that express strong emotions (e.g., oh!, wow!).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Sentence Structure</h3>
      <p>
        A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The most basic sentence structure in this language is the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) format. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Subject:</strong> The person or thing performing the action (e.g., The cat)<br />
        <strong>Verb:</strong> The action or state of being (e.g., eats)<br />
        <strong>Object:</strong> The person or thing affected by the action (e.g., the fish)<br />
        <em>Example:</em> The cat eats the fish.
      </p>
      <h3>Tenses</h3>
      <p>
        Tenses indicate the time at which an action takes place. The basic tenses are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Past:</strong> Indicates actions that have already happened (e.g., She walked).</li>
        <li><strong>Present:</strong> Indicates actions happening now (e.g., She walks).</li>
        <li><strong>Future:</strong> Indicates actions that will happen (e.g., She will walk).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Basic Punctuation</h3>
      <p>
        Punctuation marks are symbols used to clarify the meaning of sentences. Some of the most common punctuation marks include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Period (.)</strong> Used at the end of a statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Question Mark (?)</strong> Used at the end of a question.</li>
        <li><strong>Exclamation Point (!)</strong> Used to express strong emotion.</li>
        <li><strong>Comma (,)</strong> Used to separate items in a list or to set off introductory elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Apostrophe (â€™)</strong> Used to indicate possession or the omission of letters.</li>
        <li><strong>Quotation Marks (" ")</strong> Used to indicate direct speech or quotations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By mastering these basic grammar rules, you will be well on your way to constructing clear and accurate sentences. Practice using these rules in your writing and speaking to become more confident in your language skills.
