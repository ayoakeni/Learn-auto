      <h2>Pronouns and Their Uses</h2>
      <p>
        Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns in a sentence. They help to avoid repetition and make sentences easier to understand. There are several types of pronouns, each serving a different purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Here are the main types of pronouns with examples and their uses:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Personal Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Personal pronouns refer to specific people or things. They change form based on the subject, object, and possessive cases.

        <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs <br/> <em>Example: This book is mine.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Reflexive Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the sentence. They are used when the subject and the object of the sentence are the same.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves <br/> <em>Example: She made herself a sandwich.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Demonstrative Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Demonstrative pronouns point to specific things.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>this, that, these, those <br/> <em>Example: This is my car.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Interrogative Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>who, whom, whose, which, what <br/> <em>Example: What is your name?</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Relative Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses and connect them to the main clause.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>who, whom, whose, which, that <br/> <em>Example: The book that you gave me is interesting.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Indefinite Pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        Indefinite pronouns refer to nonspecific people or things.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>anyone, everyone, someone, no one, anything, everything, something, nothing <br/> <em>Example: Someone left their bag.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Using Pronouns Correctly</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some tips for using pronouns correctly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure the pronoun agrees with its antecedent in number and gender. <br/> <em>Example: Each student must bring his or her book.</em></li>
        <li>Avoid ambiguous pronoun references. Make sure it’s clear which noun the pronoun is replacing. <br/> <em>Example: When Sarah and Maria arrived, she was tired. (Unclear who "she" refers to)</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Practice</h3>
      <p>
        Replace the nouns in the following sentences with appropriate pronouns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>John and Mary went to the market. (Replace with pronouns)</li>
        <li>The dog chased the cat around the yard. (Replace with pronouns)</li>
        <li>Samantha gave the book to Samantha’s friend. (Replace with pronouns)</li>
      </ul>
