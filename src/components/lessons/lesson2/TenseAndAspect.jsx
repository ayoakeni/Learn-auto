      <h2>Grammar Rules for Tense and Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        Tense and aspect are two important components of grammar that help convey the timing and nature of an action or state. Understanding these concepts is crucial for forming correct and meaningful sentences in any language.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Tense</h3>
      <p>
        Tense refers to the time of an action or event. There are three primary tenses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Past:</strong> Indicates that an action or event occurred in the past. <br/> <em>Example: She walked to the store.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Present:</strong> Indicates that an action or event is occurring now. <br/> <em>Example: She walks to the store.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Future:</strong> Indicates that an action or event will occur in the future. <br/> <em>Example: She will walk to the store.</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        Aspect provides additional information about the temporal characteristics of an action or event, such as whether it is ongoing, completed, or habitual. There are four main aspects in English:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Describes a single action or habitual action. <br/> <em>Example: She walks (simple present), She walked (simple past), She will walk (simple future).</em></li>
        <li><strong>Progressive (Continuous):</strong> Describes an ongoing action. <br/> <em>Example: She is walking (present progressive), She was walking (past progressive), She will be walking (future progressive).</em></li>
        <li><strong>Perfect:</strong> Describes a completed action that has relevance to another point in time. <br/> <em>Example: She has walked (present perfect), She had walked (past perfect), She will have walked (future perfect).</em></li>
        <li><strong>Perfect Progressive:</strong> Describes an ongoing action that was completed at some point. <br/> <em>Example: She has been walking (present perfect progressive), She had been walking (past perfect progressive), She will have been walking (future perfect progressive).</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Combining Tense and Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        By combining tense and aspect, we can form a variety of verb tenses that give a nuanced understanding of the timing and nature of actions. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Progressive:</strong> Describes an ongoing action happening now. <br/> <em>Example: She is walking to the store.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Describes an action that was completed before another past action. <br/> <em>Example: She had walked to the store before it started raining.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Future Perfect Progressive:</strong> Describes an ongoing action that will be completed before a specified future time. <br/> <em>Example: By next year, she will have been walking to the store for five years.</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Practice</h3>
      <p>
        To practice forming sentences with different tenses and aspects, try rewriting the following sentences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>She reads a book. (Change to past progressive)</li>
        <li>They finish their homework. (Change to future perfect)</li>
        <li>He is playing soccer. (Change to past perfect progressive)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
