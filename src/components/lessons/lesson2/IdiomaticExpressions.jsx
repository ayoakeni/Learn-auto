      <h2>Common Idiomatic Expressions</h2>
      <p>
        Idiomatic expressions are phrases that have a meaning different from the literal meaning of the individual words. They add color and interest to language, but can be challenging for language learners to understand. Here are some common idiomatic expressions and their meanings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Break a leg:</strong> Good luck</li>
        <li><strong>Hit the nail on the head:</strong> Do or say something exactly right</li>
        <li><strong>Cost an arm and a leg:</strong> Be very expensive</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cat out of the bag:</strong> Reveal a secret</li>
        <li><strong>Beat around the bush:</strong> Avoid talking about something directly</li>
        <li><strong>Piece of cake:</strong> Something very easy</li>
        <li><strong>Spill the beans:</strong> Reveal a secret</li>
        <li><strong>Under the weather:</strong> Not feeling well</li>
        <li><strong>It's raining cats and dogs:</strong> Raining heavily</li>
        <li><strong>Break the ice:</strong> To initiate a conversation in a social setting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are just a few examples of idiomatic expressions. Learning idioms can help you understand and communicate more effectively in a language, but it's important to remember that idioms may vary between languages and cultures.
