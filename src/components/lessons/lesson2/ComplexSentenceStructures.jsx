      <h2>Complex Sentence Structures</h2>
      <p>
        Complex sentences are sentences that contain an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. These sentences are used to add depth and detail to your writing, allowing for a more nuanced expression of ideas.
      </p>
      <h3>Independent and Dependent Clauses</h3>
      <p>
        An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a sentence. It has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. A dependent clause, on the other hand, cannot stand alone as a sentence. It also has a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> 
        <br/>
        Independent clause: "I went to the store."
        <br/>
        Dependent clause: "because I needed to buy groceries"
        <br/>
        Complex sentence: "I went to the store because I needed to buy groceries."
      </p>
      <h3>Subordinating Conjunctions</h3>
      <p>
        Subordinating conjunctions are used to connect dependent clauses to independent clauses. Common subordinating conjunctions include because, since, although, if, when, and while.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <br/>
        - "Although it was raining, we decided to go for a hike."
        <br/>
        - "I will call you when I get home."
      </p>
      <h3>Relative Clauses</h3>
      <p>
        Relative clauses are a type of dependent clause that begin with relative pronouns such as who, whom, whose, which, and that. They provide additional information about a noun in the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <br/>
        - "The book, which I borrowed from the library, is very interesting."
        <br/>
        - "The person who called you is my friend."
      </p>
      <h3>Using Complex Sentences in Writing</h3>
      <p>
        Incorporating complex sentences into your writing can enhance clarity and coherence. They help to show relationships between ideas and add sophistication to your writing style.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Practice:</h3>
        Try combining the following sentences using subordinating conjunctions or relative clauses:
        <br/>
        - "The sun was setting. We decided to stay a bit longer."
        <br/>
        - "I have a friend. She is a talented musician."
      </p>
